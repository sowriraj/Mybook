Currently working on an automation item in LLE, where I designed a new logic using Copilot.

Used Copilot for API development, error triaging, and creating unit test cases.

Installation is still pending in some areas, but Copilot is actively helping in:

Optimizing code.

Creating/refactoring complex logic.

Drafting documentation.

Writing unit tests.



SQL Optimization & Logging:

Optimized SQL queries to extract daily important table backups (INIT1_TEST and LOAD_TEST SQL DBs).

Implemented a loop to manage config-related table backups. Upon commit, logs are generated automatically after each transaction.

Enabled error handling through log generation using PL/SQL.


Prompt Example:

Loop the PL/SQL query to do commit after each transaction, handle rollback and generate logs.

Used Copilot to improvise the logic of an existing tool for the “delete branch” utility, although no new tasks have been created using it yet.

Migration Work:

Used Copilot for migrating the existing API endpoint testing module in DatapathexpressWeb, utilizing:

Angular for the UI

.NET for the backend API
