Title: AI-Driven HealthCheck System Using Smart Wearables and Location-Based Services


---

Abstract:

The present invention relates to a system and method for real-time health monitoring and diagnostic support using AI and wearable technology. The system captures biometric data via a smartwatch or similar wearable, interprets the data using artificial intelligence, conducts interactive symptom-based questioning, and provides personalized health insights, precautionary measures, and nearby medical support based on geolocation.

Background:

Health monitoring systems have evolved with wearables, but current solutions often lack integrated AI-driven diagnostic support and location-based health service recommendations. There is a need for a holistic solution that connects real-time biometric monitoring with AI-led diagnosis, personalized lifestyle recommendations, and proximity-based healthcare services.

Summary of the Invention:

This invention provides an AI HealthCheck System that:

1. Continuously monitors health metrics through a smartwatch.


2. Analyzes trends and anomalies using AI/ML algorithms.


3. Generates intelligent health questionnaires based on initial findings.


4. Provides actionable insights, including remedies, dos and don’ts, and lifestyle adjustments.


5. Suggests healthcare providers, clinics, or specialists nearby using geolocation data.

System Components and Architecture:

1. Wearable Data Capture Module:

Utilizes sensors in smartwatches to capture:

Heart rate variability

Oxygen saturation (SpO2)

Blood pressure

Sleep patterns

Temperature

ECG (where available)

Step count & activity levels


Periodically uploads data to a secure cloud server.


2. AI-Driven Health Analysis Engine:

Real-time pattern detection using ML models trained on clinical datasets.

Detects anomalies and flags potential early warning signs (e.g., arrhythmias, hypoxia).

Triggers dynamic symptom-based questioning.

Example: If resting HR is abnormally high → AI may ask about caffeine, anxiety, infection, etc.

Uses natural language processing (NLP) for conversational interface.



3. Recommendation & Remedy Engine:

Based on diagnostic outcomes and symptom inputs, the AI suggests:

Natural/home remedies

Over-the-counter medicines (where legal)

Lifestyle dos and don’ts (e.g., hydration, exercise, rest)


Tracks user history to avoid conflicting suggestions.

Provides emergency warnings if required (e.g., chest pain + high HR).


4. Location-Based Services (LBS) Module:

Uses GPS from smartwatch/phone to:

Locate nearby hospitals, clinics, or pharmacies.

Filter by specialization (e.g., cardiologist, pulmonologist).

Prioritize by proximity, ratings, insurance coverage (if integrated).


Includes map view, directions, and contact options.


5. User Interface:

Mobile and smartwatch UI with push notifications.

Conversational AI assistant.

Health timeline & history dashboard.

Alert system for critical conditions.

Example Use Case:

1. User feels fatigued, but doesn’t realize oxygen levels are low.


2. Smartwatch detects SpO2 drop to 92% with high HR at rest.


3. AI asks follow-up questions via app: "Are you experiencing shortness of breath, fever, or cough?"


4. User responds “yes” to mild cough and fatigue.


5. AI suggests: Possible respiratory infection; rest, fluids, check for fever.


6. Nearby doctor recommendations: Pulmonologist within 2 miles; urgent care clinic open nearby.


7. Option to book appointment or call directly through app.

Key Technologies Involved:

Smartwatch Sensors (PPG, ECG, accelerometer)

Cloud Computing for data aggregation and model inference

Artificial Intelligence:

Machine Learning (anomaly detection, symptom classification)

Natural Language Processing (questionnaire, chatbot)

Recommendation Systems (remedies and doctor suggestions)


Geolocation Services (Google Maps API, Apple Maps, etc.)

Data Security & HIPAA/GDPR Compliance

Advantages Over Existing Systems:

Fully integrated AI diagnostic + wearable + location services.

Proactive care vs. reactive diagnostics.

Personalized and adaptive over time.

Improves access to care, especially in urgent or unclear situations.
